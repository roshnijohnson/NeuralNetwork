# Neural Network

## Description:

A Neural Nework is implemented and trained on the 
Wine Quality Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv)
The Input variables are:
0 - fixed acidity
1 - volatile acidity
2 - citric acid
3 - residual sugar
4 - chlorides
5 - free sulfur dioxide
6 - total sulfur dioxide
7 - density
8 - pH
9 - sulphates
10 - alcohol
11 - quality 

Before running the neural network, the data is pre-processed, which includes converting categorical to numerical attributes, handle null or missing values, standardization and normalization.

The neural network is trained using different activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh & ReLU. Training and testing error sum for different activation functions is calculated and compared to get the best activation function on the given dataset.  

The dataset used here is from UCI and can be accessed directly using the link provided in the code.
